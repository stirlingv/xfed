	</header>

	<span class="image main"><img src="{% static 'images/pic11.jpg' %}" alt="" /></span>

	<p>This is the main content area for the Generic page. To customize this content, go to the admin panel and create Page Content entries for the 'generic' page. You can add multiple content sections, upload images, and organize them in any order you prefer.</p>
	<p>This paragraph demonstrates how multiple content blocks can be displayed. Each paragraph or section can be managed separately through the Page Content admin section, allowing you to easily update, reorder, or remove content as needed.</p>
	<p>To get started, log into the admin panel, navigate to "Page Contents" and create new entries with the page field set to "generic". You can then add titles, content, and images for each section.</p>

	<hr class="major" />

	<h2>Admin-Managed Content Section 1</h2>
	<p>This section represents a content block that can be managed through the admin panel. In the Page Content admin, you would create an entry with section_type set to "main_content" and add your custom title and content here.</p>
	<p>Each content section can include rich text formatting, links, images, and other HTML elements. The admin interface provides an easy way to add and edit this content without touching code.</p>

	<hr class="major" />

	<h2>Admin-Managed Content Section 2</h2>
	<p>This is another example content section. You can create as many sections as needed through the admin panel. Each section can have its own title, content, and optional image. Use the "order" field to control the sequence in which sections appear.</p>
	<p>The Page Content model allows for flexible content management, making it easy for non-technical users to maintain and update website content through the user-friendly admin interface.</p>

	<hr class="major" />

	<h2>Admin-Managed Content Section 3</h2>
	<p>This final section shows how consistent formatting is maintained across all content blocks. When you create Page Content entries in the admin, they will automatically inherit the site's styling and layout.</p>
	<p>Remember: this placeholder content will be replaced automatically when you add actual Page Content entries for the 'generic' page through the Django admin interface.</p>
